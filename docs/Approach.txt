Baseline Method: Naive Bayes with Tokens

Evaluation: Custom Designed over SPAN for NER

Issue 1 : No Sequential Information, Example attached in PPT(add dependency point)
Issue 2 : No POS Tags used as a feature, which provide valuable information about Entity
Issue 3 : No Contextual Information as Naive Bayes is count based method(relation between tokens)

Solution to Issue 1 : Use LSTM for Sequential Information
Solution to Issue 2 : Use POS as a feature
Solution to Issue 3 : Use CRF for getting Contextual Information

Advanced Method: POS based CRF-LSTM Model to counter issues in the Baseline Model

Research Question: What do Sequence models see in NER which can't be done by Naive Bayes? The reason behind it's amazing results.
