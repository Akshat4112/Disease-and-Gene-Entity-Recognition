**Interpreting Bidirectional-LSTM-CRF model for Disease Entities Recognition**
================

The project was developed by Akshat Gupta and Silvia Cunico under the guidance of Prof. Roman Klinger, from the University of Stuttgart.
The program has 2 main purposes:
- Recognizing disease entities in text documents and labeling them according to the BIO labels
- Interpreting the model's predictions with the LIME and GALE approximation techniques to explain the BI-LSTM CRF model

## Installation
---------------

This program was developed using Python version 3.9.6 and was tested on Linux and Windows system.
We recommend using Anaconda 4.2 for installing **Python 3.9** as well as **numpy**, although you can install them by other means.

If you wish to run the code, you can install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

1. **Tensorflow** GPU 2.7.0:

If GPU is not available, tensorflow CPU can be used instead:
> pip install tensorflow==2.7.0

2. **Keras** 2.9.0:
3. **Sklearn** 0.21.0:
4. **NLTK** 3.2.5:
5. **Eli5**:
Currently it requires scikit-learn 0.18+
> conda install -c conda-forge eli5


## Task
-----------

Train a model given a labeled dataset to provide a "B-DISEASE" or "I-DISEASE" tag for each disease entity and "O" for all the remaining tokens on an unlabeled corpus. A classical application is Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Clinical or Biomedical NLP. Here is an example:

```
John   has   been   diagnosed   with    sporadic      T-cell	    leukaemia	
O      O     O      O           O       B-DISEASE     I-DISEASE     I-DISEASE

```
After training a model:
    1. Given a predicition result, evaluate its accuracy and F1 score (confusion matrix). 
    2. Generate explanations to get both a local and a global linear approximation of the modelâ€™s behaviour. 

### Datasets
------------

The dataset used to train our models was provided to us internally from the University stuff, for the purpose of developing this project.

If you may wish to use the code you can provide a dataset with the same format so that it will be processed regularly and written as a pandas DataFrame in a CSV file. 
The format we refer to follows roughly the CoNLL 2003 format for NER task (https://aclanthology.org/W03-0419.pdf): the data file must contain one word per line. At the end of each line a tag must state whether the current word is part of a named entity or not. In our case the fields in a line must be two, the word and its entity tag. The part of-speech tag and the chunk tag are not part of the required fields. It is essential that the two required fields are tab-separated.



### Results
----------

Results' plots from our trainings and evaluations of the BI-CRF-LSTM model on our NCBI-based dataset were stored through the NeuralNetwork's method Training_plots as .png files in the /figures/ data folder.

If you may wish to create plots of the accuracy and losses of your models, please create a /figures folder, too.


### Usage
---------
The program was written so that it can run to distinguish "DISEASE" entities from other entities with the highest accuracy.
To reach such training accuracy (99,82) and validation accuracy (99,29%) we implemented: 

1. A baseline method following the Naive Bayes algorithm to train and test;
2. An advanced method with a Bidirectional-LSTM-CRF model with BioBERT Embeddings.
